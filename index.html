<p>Children readily absorb information in the early years of their lives.</p>

<p><b><u>Little Head Starters</u></b> is a structured, <strong><i>fun</i></strong>, weekly program providing the opportunity for young children to be exposed to <strong>literacy and numeracy skills</strong> before they attend school.</p>

<p>Learning is play-based through <strong>songs, games and activities.</strong></p>

<p>This <u>parent/child interactive program</u> for 2-6 year olds focuses on:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><font color="red">Alphabet</font> recognition &amp; phonics (sight words for advanced kids)</li>
		<li><font color="red">Number</font> recognition &amp; counting (simple mathematics for advanced)</li>
		<li><font color="red">Colours, Shapes</font></li>
		<li><font color="red">Clock, Calendar</font></li>
		<li><font color="red">Memory</font> enhancement</li>
		<li><font color="red">Social</font> skills, eg sharing, taking turns and show and tell</li>      
		<li>Fine motor and gross <font color="red">motor skills</font></li>          			
      	</ul>
	  
	  <p>The program structure consists of:
<br><br>
<b><u>Group time:</u></b>
<br>We begin with a <b>greeting song</b> where each child suggests an action for the group to follow.
<br>We look at the <b>calendar</b> and learn through songs about the days of the week, months and seasons.
<br>During ‘Mail Time’, each child receives a letter with their name on it (name recognition) and the <b>letter</b> of the day is revealed and its corresponding sound is practised. A mini <b>show & tell</b> with objects beginning with that sound follows to help develop the child’s confidence skills.<br>
<br>The <b>number</b> of the day is presented and we sing songs and play games with numbers.
<br>We look at the time on our <b>clock</b> and investigate the <b>shape</b> of the day.</p>
<p><b><u>Table top activities</u></b>
<br>These activities help to develop <b>fine motor skills</b>, imagination and reinforce the theme. Activities include <b>craft, play dough, tracing/colouring, working with pegs, and threading</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b><u>Body coordination games</b></u>
<br>Games which include jumping, crawling, throwing and catching balls, etc help to develop <b>gross motor skills</b> and spatial awareness.</p>
<p><b><u>Story time</u></b>
<br>Language and concepts continue to develop during story time.  Questions are posed to encourage children to think and express ideas.

<br>The program includes many activities to engage and challenge your child. It provides the opportunity for you and your child to spend quality learning time together as well as time to interact with others.
</p>

<p>Parent participation ensures that every child receives one-on-one attention whilst attending the session and can take home ideas and skills to continue learning at home. It is extremely rewarding to be actively involved in your child's development.</p>
